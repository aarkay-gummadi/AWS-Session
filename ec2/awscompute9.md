Serverless
-----------

* To run the code with web interfaces, we use servers (web/app/..) and we run them continuously for the application to be accessible & available
* Serverless technology is all about writing code as a function.
* This function will be executed only when the calls are made and the results will be processed
* The Serverless technology provider internally runs the server when the calls are made.
* AWS Lambda is Serverless Provider who enables to write code using
    * java 
    * c#
    * python
    * javascript
    * go
    * php
* Charges will be applied only for the duration when the function is getting executed.
* Pricing will be in the units of milliseconds
* Serverless technology has no common standards, so we need to rewrite the code.
* Lets create our first lambdd
* From AWS lambda we can use boto3 which is sdk to interact with AWS

* Exercise:
   * Try to find the code to start ec2 instances by tag using boto3
   * Try to find the code to terminate databases based on tags
   * Create a hello world python lambda function.

* [refer here](https://github.com/alfonsof/aws-python-examples) for boto3 examples

* The lambda functions 
```
